    <p>Booking couldn’t be simpler. Just click here to e-mail us or from your regular e-mail system, contact us
        at <a href="mailto:enquiries@creativeretreatsandholidays.co.uk">enquiries@creativeretreatsandholidays.co.uk</a>
    </p>

    <p>and tell us:-</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How many people you’re booking for?</li>
        <li>When you’d like to come and how long for?</li>
        <li>Whether you’d like a short break, a holiday or a retreat?</li>
        <li>If you have a preference, whether you’d like to do glass appliqué, copper foil or leaded glass?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As soon as we’ve confirmed availability, a non-refundable deposit of £65 per person will confirm your booking.
        The balance needs to be paid no later than 14 days before the event.</p>

    <h2>Cancellation policy.</h2>

    <p>For bookings cancelled more than three months in advance a full refund will be given.</p>

    <p>For cancellations one to three months in advance, the full cost of the break can be credited to a new booking or
        CR&amp;H gift voucher.</p>

    <p>Cancellations one week to one month in advance will incur a forfeit of 50% of the cost of the break being
        cancelled; the remaining 50% will be credited towards the cost of a new booking or CR&amp;H gift voucher.</p>

    <p>No refunds or credit will be given for cancellations within one week of the booked start date. </p>

    <h2>Health and safety:</h2>

    <p>Your wellbeing is very important to us. When working with glass, you will need to wear closed-in footwear (sorry,
        no sandals).</p>

    <p>We also suggest wearing old clothes, especially if working on leaded glass.</p>

    <p>We will provide safety glasses and gloves where needed, and also plasters if required! If you need glasses,
        please don’t forget to bring them. Please let us know if you wear contact lenses; we will lend you safety
        goggles instead of safety glasses.</p>

    <p>For fusing students working with powdered glass, face masks are required; these are available to purchase, or you
        can bring your own.</p>
