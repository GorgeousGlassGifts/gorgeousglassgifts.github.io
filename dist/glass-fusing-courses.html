        <p>Glass fusing courses and breaks are
            available throughout the year, at dates to suit yourself. Please e-mail
            or phone us (before 9pm please) to check availability. Because we
            specialise in small group sizes, we can usually fit you in with no need
            to meet minimum numbers for our Chilham classes. Please note that due to
            the higher cost of&nbsp;fusing glass and materials plus the cost of
            running the kiln,&nbsp;glass fusing courses cost £85 per day.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A few events currently in the pipeline are:-</p>

                <p><span class="lead">Saturday 12th – Sunday 13th September: NEW: First steps in
                    glass fusing.</span></p>

                <p>Suitable for all, though prior experience in cutting glass (e.g. on
                    an appliqué or stained glass course) will be an advantage.</p>

                <p>Come and discover the wonderful world of fused glass in our Chilham
                    glass studio, in the heart of Kent. Use fusing glass. Glass
                    confetti, frit and stringers to create your own unique designs. You
                    will have the opportunity to make at least three pieces of work; a
                    textured piece from float glass, coasters, a small bowl, a window
                    hanging and / or jewellery. These will be fused in our kiln
                    following the course and will be ready for collection or posting the
                    following week. (Postage will be charged at cost.)</p>

                <p><span class="lead">Tuesday 15th – Wednesday 16th September: NEW: Tack fusing for texture</span></p>

                <p>Discover the effects you can get when glass is heated enough to stick
                    together permanently but not so much as to completely melt. Using
                    fusing glass together with frit and / or stringers, create your own
                    unique pieces of glass art to impress your friends. You should
                    expect to make two or three items, depending on size. These will be
                    fused in our kiln following the course and will be ready for
                    collection or posting the following week. (Postage will be charged
                    at cost.)</p>

                <p>Suitable for first time fusers or those who have done an introduction

                    a picture and / or jewellery. You can choose to make one large piece
                    or several smaller ones. All materials provided.&nbsp;Your work&nbsp;will
                    be fused in our kiln following the course and will be ready for
                    collection or posting the following week. (Postage will be charged

                    fused candle stands.</span></p>

                <p>Following on from our 3D copper foiling, a weekend of 3D glass
                    appliqué and fused candle holders. The appliqué candle holders will
                    be made in four pieces (plus a base) and will then be assembled. The
                    intention is to make and grout the appliqué cubes on the Saturday,
                    then assemble them and make the fused candle stands on the Sunday.
                    These will be fused and slumped in the kiln the following week ready
                    for collection or postage. (Postage will be charged at cost.)</p>

                </p>

                <p>Explore the possibilities of tack fusing in our Chilham studio. Using
                    a similar technique to glass appliqué but with fusing glass, create
                    a picture or pattern of your choice, then fuse it in the kiln to
                    permanently join the pieces together.</p>

                <p>Your work will be ready to collect or post a few days later. (Postage
                    will be charged at cost.)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>November and December dates are coming soon, unless you book them for
            yourself first! How about a "make your own decorations" day?</p>
